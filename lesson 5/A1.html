                 <h2>RATAN TATA</h2>

                 <P>Ratan Tata is one of Indiaâ€™s most respected industrialists, known for transforming the Tata Group into a global business empire while staying rooted in values like integrity, simplicity, and social responsibility. Born in 1937 into the prominent Tata family, he was raised by his grandmother after his parents separated, and he completed his education in architecture and structural engineering at Cornell University, followed by management studies at Harvard. He began his career in the Tata Group in 1962, starting from the shop floor, and over the decades earned his place as the successor to J.R.D. Tata, eventually becoming chairman of Tata Sons in 1991.

                    Under Ratan Tata's leadership, the Tata Group saw an unprecedented transformation. He modernized operations, merged overlapping companies, and emphasized international expansion. His bold decisions included acquiring Tetley Tea, Corus Steel, and Jaguarâ€“Land Rover, turning the Tata Group into a globally recognized conglomerate. He was also behind the launch of the Tata Nano, the worldâ€™s cheapest car, aimed at making transportation affordable for Indian families. Though the Nano was not a commercial success, it became symbolic of Tata's commitment to innovation and inclusive progress.
                    
                    Ratan Tata's business philosophy was never just about profitâ€”it was about doing the right thing. He believed in ethical leadership and responsible capitalism, and this ethos was evident in his personal conduct and in the way he ran the group. Even after retiring in 2012, and again briefly returning as interim chairman in 2016â€“2017, he remained active through philanthropic work, especially via the Tata Trusts, which focus on education, healthcare, and rural development. He is also known for quietly supporting startups and mentoring young entrepreneurs, showing a forward-looking interest in Indiaâ€™s future.
                    
                    Despite being a public figure, Ratan Tata has always maintained a low profile in personal matters. He is unmarried, enjoys flying and cars, and is known for his love of animals, especially dogs. Widely admired for his humility and moral clarity, he is often described as a statesman of Indian industry. His leadership has left a lasting legacy not only in terms of economic growth but also in establishing a model of business that balances ambition with conscience.</P>
